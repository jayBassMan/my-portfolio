            My name is Jonathan Johnson and I am a full-stack Web Application
            Developer and Software Developer. I am currently living in Dallas, Tx.
            I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer and Electronic Engineering Science from the
            University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and Southern Methodis University Coding Bootcamp.
            My primary focus and inspiration for my studies is Web
            Development. In my free time, I study human computer interface and the
            psychology of human computer interaction. I am both driven and
            self-motivated. I constantly experiment with new
            technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Web
            Development, and strive to better myself as a developer, and the
            development community as a whole.Languages List
            I have been studying software development since 2009 and I develop in C, Java, C++, and C#.
            I am experienced in both front and back-end development, and I am proficient in HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, LESS,
            SASS, XML, JavaScript, jQuery, and SQL/MySQL, to name a few.
